Whether it’s grabbing coffee after school drop-off, a dinner date, a networking event, or a weekend trip away, nurturing friendships will reap huge dividends. Friendships are not a luxury you’ll make time for in the future so use this card guilt-free now. No partner resentment allowed either, as a girls’ or guys’ night out is about so much more than a cocktail. It’s about cultivating relationships that will support and sustain you along with boosting the health of your marriage.",

This cardholder will CPE ongoing time for fun, such as arranging to throw a football around in the park at twilight, creating a weekly family game night, or any other activities your kids enjoy.

Either way—or somewhere in the middle—gift giving is an opportunity to connect with and thank the very important people in your life, which requires year-round CPE.
