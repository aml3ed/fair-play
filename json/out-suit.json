Do a happy dance if siblings are invited so you can have two kids in the same place at the same time.Note! If you have two or more kids who have to be at separate birthday celebrations, you and your partner can both hold this card separately. A Kid Split means you both CPE the same card at the same time but for separate kids. See page 267 for more about splitting cards.Post Note! This card pairs with the “transportation (kids)” and “gifts (VIPs)” cards.
