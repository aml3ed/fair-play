# Fair Play Cards

This repository provides a list of all of the cards in the [Fair Play](https://www.fairplaylife.com) system by Eve Rodsky. The cards are available in `.md` and `.json` formats.

This project is meant to make the data more open and accessible to others. However, I **strongly recommend** buying [the book](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/605905/fair-play-by-eve-rodsky/9780525541943/) and [game](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/647409/the-fair-play-deck-by-eve-rodsky/9780593231661/) to support the original creators.

## What's "Fair Play"?

_From the website:_

> The Fair Play book delivers a time and anxiety saving system that offers couples a completely new way to divvy up their domestic responsibilities. It started with the “Sh\*t I Do” spreadsheet – a list of all the invisible tasks it takes to run a home, but developed into a gamified system with four easy-to-follow rules, 100 household tasks, and a figurative card game you play with your partner. Remember: Fair Play is a practice. Just like riding a bike for the first time it might feel awkward and you might fall down, but with time it will come as second nature to you!
